# PURPOSE:
#   Provides a utility function `load_instructions_file` that reads plain text
#   from a file â€” typically used to load prompt instructions or descriptions
#   for LLM agents. If the file is not found or unreadable, a default string is returned.
# =============================================================================

# Import the `os` module for working with file paths and environment context (not used here but common in loaders).
